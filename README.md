# Tales from the loop


<img src = "img/loop_system.png">
This is an implementation of the Tales from the Loop game system for Foundry VTT.  

The current sheet implements the data model and is set up for record-keeping. It is more than possible to run a game with the system in this state.

I am still working out how I want to implement building dice pools and rolling but that should be relatively soon at which point the system will be feature complete.

in the mean time:  Roll dice as such a simple /r #d6cs6  where # is the number of dice in your pool.  simple as that.

feedback is always welcome.
